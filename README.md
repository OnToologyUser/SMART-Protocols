SMART-Protocols
===============
The SeMAntic RepresenTation for Protocols, SMART Protocols, provides two ontology modules expressed in OWL to represent the document and workflow aspects of experimental protocols. The SMART Protocols-Document module aims to provide a structured vocabulary of concepts to represent information for reporting an experimental protocol. The SMART Protocols-Workflow module aims to provide a structured vocabulary of concepts to represent the execution of experimental protocols.
