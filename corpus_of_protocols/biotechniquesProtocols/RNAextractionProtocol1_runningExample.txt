Protocol overview

• The extraction method (steps 2–21) is taken from the method supplied with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK).

• Recover tumor tissue at the time of surgery, trim into 1-cm3 fragments, and immerse immediately in TRIzol reagent prior to freezing at -80°C.

• Thaw and weigh tissue prior to RNA extraction, working quickly.

• Use a tissue power homogenizer (or a mortar and pestle) to homogenize tissue by hand.

• All centrifugation steps are carried out at 4°C.


Procedure

1. Prior to RNA extraction:

a. Autoclave or wash equipment (i.e., tissue storage container, homogenizer blades, forceps, scalpel holder) in Neutracon solution for 2–4 h.

b. Rinse equipment well in 1% SDS (prepared using DEPC-treated or other nuclease-free water).

c. Rinse in 100% ethanol and leave to air-dry.

2. Weigh thawed sample to determine quantity of TRIzol reagent required (use 1 mL TRIzol per 50–100 mg of tissue).

3. Homogenize sample using tissue homogenizer.

4. Centrifuge at 12,000x g for 10 min.

5. Transfer cleared homogenate to fresh tube; discard insoluble material and upper fat layer, if present.

6. Incubate homogenized sample at room temperature for 5 min.

7. Add 0.2 mL chloroform per 1 mL TRIzol and cap tube tightly.

8. Shake vigorously by hand for 15 s.

9. Incubate at room temperature for 3 min.

10. Centrifuge at 12,000x g for 15 min.

11. Transfer aqueous phase (colorless upper phase) to a new tube.

12. Retain organic phase for DNA/protein extraction, if required (store at -20°C).

13. Add 0.5 mL isopropyl alcohol per 1 mL TRIzol.

14. Incubate at room temperature for 10 min.

15. Centrifuge at 12,000x g for 10 min (RNA forms a gel-like pellet on the side and bottom of the tube; discard the supernatant).

16. Add 1 mL 75% ethanol per 1 mL TRIzol and vortex for 10 s.

17. Centrifuge at 7500x g for 5 min.

18. Air-dry RNA pellet for 5–10 min.

19. Add 20 µL RNase-free water and mix by gentle pipetting.

20. Incubate at 60°C for 10 min.

21. Store RNA in labeled tube at -80°C until required.
