  <LI><FONT face="arial,verdana, helvetica" color=#000000 size=2>Select the 
  488-nm excitation wavelength on the argon laser by adjusting the wavelength 
  selector prism. Optimize the output power by fine tuning the position of the 
  high-reflector mirror using the control knobs at the back of the laser. 
</FONT>
  <LI><FONT face="arial,verdana, helvetica" color=#000000 size=2>Set the 
  frequency synthesizer to drive the AOM to approx. 40 MHz at a resonance 
  frequency (for the experiments described herein, a driving frequency of 40.112 
  MHz is used). This gives rise to intensity oscillations in the laser light 
  beam at twice the driving frequency (80.224 MHz). </FONT>
  <LI><FONT face="arial,verdana, helvetica" color=#000000 size=2>Optimize the 
  diffraction in the AOM and thereby the modulation depth by adjusting the angle 
  of incidence and monitoring the intensity of the undiffracted zero order beam 
  with a power meter. The optimal angle of diffraction (corresponding to maximal 
  diffraction) gives rise to a minimum in the output power of the zero-order 
  beam. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT face="arial,verdana, helvetica" color=#000000 size=2>Turn on the MCP 
  and the CCD. Set the bias of the photocathode voltage to -2 V and adjust the 
  gain to match the full dynamic range on the CCD. This is dependent on the 
  fluorescence intensity of the sample and must be determined empirically. 
  Ideally, keep the gain as low as possible to reduce noise. Typically, the gain 
  is set at 1 for the Hamamatsu C5825, with the gain of the Photometrics Quantix 
  CCD set at 3. Set the readout of the CCD to 2 x 2 binning. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT face="arial,verdana, helvetica" color=#000000 size=2>Set the master 
  frequency synthesizer driving the MCP to a value exactly double (for the above 
  example: 80.224 MHz) that driving the AOM. </FONT>
