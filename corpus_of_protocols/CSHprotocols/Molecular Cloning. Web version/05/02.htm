  <LI><FONT face="arial,verdana, helvetica" color=#000000 size=2>Detect DNA 
  banding patterns in agarose gels using either ethidium bromide or SYBR 
  Gold.<BR>To detect DNA using <B>Ethidium bromide</B>, prepare a stock solution 
  of 10 mg/ml in H<SUB>2</SUB>O, and store it at room temperature in dark 
  bottles or bottles wrapped in aluminum foil. The dye is usually incorporated 
  into agarose gels and electrophoresis buffers at a concentration of 0.5 µg/ml. 
  Note that polyacrylamide gels cannot be cast with ethidium bromide because it 
  inhibits polymerization of the acrylamide. Acrylamide gels are therefore 
  stained with the ethidium solution after the gel has been run (please see <A href="10.htm">Chapter 
  5, Protocol 10</A>). Although the electrophoretic mobility of linear 
  double-stranded DNA is reduced approx. 15% in the presence of the dye, the 
  ability to examine the agarose gels directly under UV illumination during or 
  at the end of the run is a great advantage. However, sharper DNA bands are 
  obtained when electrophoresis is carried out in the absence of ethidium 
  bromide. Staining is accomplished by immersing the gel in electrophoresis 
  buffer or H<SUB>2</SUB>O containing ethidium bromide (0.5 µg/ml) for 30-45 
  minutes at room temperature. Destaining is not usually required. However, 
  detection of very small amounts (&lt;10 ng) of DNA is made easier if the 
  background fluorescence caused by unbound ethidium bromide is reduced by 
  soaking the stained gel in H<SUB>2</SUB>O or 1 mM MgSO<SUB>4</SUB> for 20 
  minutes at room temperature.<BR>To stain DNA in agarose gels using <B>SYBR 
  Gold</B>, prepare a 1:10,000-fold dilution of the stock dye solution and, 
  after electrophoretic separation of the DNA fragments, soak the gel in this 
  solution. SYBR Gold should not be added to the molten agarose or to the gel 
  before electrophoresis, because its presence in the hardened gel will cause 
  severe distortions in the electrophoretic properties of DNA and RNA. The 
  greatest sensitivity is obtained when the gel is illuminated with UV light at 
  300 nm. The dye is sensitive to fluorescent light, and working solutions 
  containing SYBR Gold (1:10,000 dilution of the stock solution supplied by 
  Molecular Probes) should be freshly prepared in electrophoresis buffer on a 
  daily basis and stored at room temperature.<BR>SYBR Gold is the trade name of 
  a new ultrasensitive dye with high affinity for DNA and a large fluorescence 
  enhancement upon binding to nucleic acid. The quantum yield of the SYBR 
  Gold-DNA complex is greater than that of the equivalent ethidium bromide-DNA 
  complex and the fluorescence enhancement is &gt;1000 times greater. As a 
  result, &lt;20 pg of double-stranded DNA can be detected in an agarose gel (up 
  to 25 times less than the amount visible after ethidium bromide staining). In 
  addition, staining of agarose or polyacrylamide gels with this dye can reveal 
  as little as 100 pg of single-stranded DNA in a band or 300 pg of RNA. SYBR 
  Gold shows maximum excitation at 495 nm and has a secondary excitation peak at 
  300 nm. Fluorescent emission occurs at 537 nm. Photography is carried out with 
  green or yellow filters as described below in Step 2. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT face="arial,verdana, helvetica" color=#000000 size=2>Record the 
  banding pattern of DNA resolved through the gel by photography.<BR>Photographs 
  of ethidium-bromide-stained gels may be made using transmitted or incident UV 
  light. Most commercially available devices (transilluminators) emit UV light 
  at 302 nm. The fluorescent yield of ethidium bromide-DNA complexes is 
  considerably greater at this wavelength than at 366 nm and slightly less than 
  at short-wavelength (254 nm) light. However, the amount of nicking of the DNA 
  is much less at 302 nm than at 254 nm. A further 10-20-fold increase in the 
  sensitivity of conventional photography can be obtained by staining DNA with 
  SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes). Detection of DNAs stained with this dye requires 
  the use of a yellow or green gelatin or cellophane filter (S-7569, available 
  from Molecular Probes or Kodak) with the camera and illumination with 300-nm 
  UV light. </FONT></LI></OL></FONT><BR><BR><FONT
